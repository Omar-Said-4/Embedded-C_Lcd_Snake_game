## Used Tools:
- AVR atmega 32 micro controller.
- 16x2 character LCD. 
- 4 push buttons.
- One Potentiometer.
- Eclipse (for programming and debugging).
## Game Controls:
- Game has 4 push buttons each one is used to move the snake in a certain direction (up-down-right-left).
(The move right and move left push buttons are used to  choose the game difficulty initially).

## Game Description:
- The snake appears initially as a single pixel on the LCD and as it eats more apples it's number of pixels increase (AKA snake length).
- This game version is based on boundaries mode where you can't move through the borders of the visual LCD display screen.
- Game is over when the snake eats itself or hits one of the four walls of the LCD display.
- You win the game immediately when the snake length reaches 30 (AKA number of pixels).
